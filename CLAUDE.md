- Use TypeScript and React for the frontend (single-page web app)
- Use Python and FastAPI for the backend
- Use the official Bauplan Python SDK to authenticate to the Bauplan API
- Reference the Bauplan docs at docs.bauplanlabs.com for client API details (this app is focused on the get_commits endpoint)
- Store secrets in .env (e.g. BPLN_KEY is the Bauplan API key)
- Keep README.md updated and ensure it's clear and well-structured
- The core design principles are:
  - Frontend craft: Does the UI feel polished, accessible, and responsive?
  - Communication: Can someone follow your thinking without asking questions?
  - Taste: Can you make complexity feel simple?
